        "*   The `combinedDataframe` and `outputDataframe` were adjusted to a 15-minute frequency. All hourly data (PV power, heat pump load, and individual PV arrays) were resampled to 15-minute intervals and forward-filled to align with the quarter-hourly household load.\n",
        "*   The simulation loop was successfully adapted to calculate energy balances at 15-minute intervals, applying a `timestep_factor` of 0.25 hours for all power-to-energy conversions.\n",
        "*   Yearly summary calculations for energy totals (e.g., household consumption, total PV power, self-usage, grid feed-in/consumption) were correctly updated by multiplying summed power values by the `timestep_factor` (0.25) and dividing by 1000 to convert from Wh to kWh.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The simulation now provides a more granular view of energy flows (at 15-minute intervals), enabling more precise analysis of self-consumption, battery usage, and grid interaction.\n",
        "*   The approach of forward-filling hourly data to 15-minute intervals assumes constant power over each quarter-hour. For future refinements, consider exploring more sophisticated interpolation methods if higher accuracy for hourly components is critical.\n"

        "*   Les données de charge domestique ont été générées avec succès à une fréquence de 15 minutes pour 2019, avec le modèle journalier adapté à 96 points par jour. La génération de la charge de la pompe à chaleur est restée à une fréquence horaire.\n",
        "*   Le `combinedDataframe` et l'`outputDataframe` ont été ajustés à une fréquence de 15 minutes. Toutes les données horaires (puissance PV, charge de la pompe à chaleur et panneaux PV individuels) ont été rééchantillonnées à des intervalles de 15 minutes et remplies vers l'avant pour s'aligner avec la charge domestique quart-horaire.\n",
        "*   La boucle de simulation a été adaptée avec succès pour calculer les bilans énergétiques à des intervalles de 15 minutes, en appliquant un `timestep_factor` de 0,25 heures pour toutes les conversions puissance-énergie.\n",
        "*   Les calculs récapitulatifs annuels pour les totaux d'énergie (par exemple, consommation domestique, puissance PV totale, auto-consommation, injection/consommation du réseau) ont été correctement mis à jour en multipliant les valeurs de puissance additionnées par le `timestep_factor` (0,25) et en divisant par 1000 pour convertir de Wh en kWh.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights ou prochaines étapes\n",
        "*   La simulation offre désormais une vue plus granulaire des flux d'énergie (par intervalles de 15 minutes), permettant une analyse plus précise de l'auto-consommation, de l'utilisation de la batterie et de l'interaction avec le réseau.\n",
        "*   L'approche de remplissage vers l'avant des données horaires à des intervalles de 15 minutes suppose une puissance constante sur chaque quart d'heure. Pour de futures améliorations, envisagez d'explorer des méthodes d'interpolation plus sophistiquées si une plus grande précision pour les composants horaires est critique.\n"

        "*   **Code and Data Initialization Translations**: All comments within the initial code cells defining `location`, `arrays` (PV panels), and `battery` parameters were successfully translated into French. This included detailed explanations of PVGIS azimuth conventions and battery discharge limits.\n",
        "*   **Load Data Generation and Loading Translation**: Comments and print statements related to the generation of dummy household load data (at 15-minute frequency) and heat pump load data (at hourly frequency) were translated to French. The code successfully created and saved these as CSV files, then loaded them into DataFrames with translated comments for the rescaling and renaming steps.\n",
        "*   **Combined DataFrame Adjustment Translation**: All comments and print statements for combining and resampling the various DataFrames were translated to French. This process successfully re-sampled all data to a 15-minute frequency, aligning PV power, household load, and heat pump load for the simulation, and initialized new columns for simulation outputs.\n",
        "*   **Simulation Loop Translation**: The entire simulation loop, including all internal comments and the final print statement, was translated to French. The logic was adapted to a 15-minute (quarter-hourly) timestep, explicitly using a `timestep_factor` of 0.25 for energy calculations.\n",
        "*   **Annual Results Summary Translation**: Print statements and labels for the annual energy summary were fully translated into French. Key findings included:\n",
        "    *   Household consumption: 3650 kWh\n",
        "    *   Total solar power production: 6231 kWh\n",
        "    *   Solar efficiency: 733 kWh/kWp\n",
        "    *   Direct self-consumption: 1489 kWh (23.9% of PV production)\n",
        "    *   Battery discharge: 1351 kWh (21.7% of PV production)\n",
        "    *   Grid feed-in: 3321 kWh (53.3% of PV production)\n",
        "    *   Grid consumption: 810 kWh (22.2% of total consumption)\n",
        "*   **Annual Summary Visualization Translation**: A bar plot summarizing the annual energy results was generated with all titles and axis labels translated to French, such as 'Résumé Annuel de la Consommation et de la Production Énergétique' for the title and 'Énergie (kWh)' for the y-axis.\n",
        "*   **Temporal Analysis Plot Translation**: The plot showing energy flows and battery charge levels over the year was updated with French axis labels ('Puissance (W)', 'Niveau de charge batterie (Wh)') and French legend entries for the various energy components (e.g., 'Production PV', 'Auto-consommation', 'Injection réseau').\n",
        "*   **Explanatory Text Cell Translation**: All remaining explanatory markdown cells throughout the notebook were translated from English to French, ensuring a fully localized document.\n",

        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The simulation now offers a more granular view (15-minute intervals) of energy flows, enabling a more precise analysis of self-consumption, battery usage, and grid interaction.\n",
        "*   For future improvements, consider exploring more sophisticated interpolation methods for hourly components if higher precision is critical, as the current approach uses forward-filling for resampling, assuming constant power over each quarter-hour.\n"
